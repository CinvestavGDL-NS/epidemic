Abstract:
The evolution of an epidemic is strongly related to the behavior of individuals, and the consideration of cause and effect of social phenomena can extend epidemiological models and allow for better identification, prediction and control of the impacts of containment and mitigation measures. This work proposes an agent-based model to simulate the double causality that exists between individual behaviors, influenced by the cultural orientation of a population, and the evolution of an epidemic, focusing on recent studies on the COVID-19 pandemic. To do this, concepts from the social sciences are used, such as the theory of planned behavior, as well as Bayesian inference to abstract the decision-making processes involved in human behavior.  A set of simulation experiments with different populations was developed to demonstrate the role that the cultural orientation of a population plays in the management of an epidemic.  
The results agree with the revised theory, showing that in populations that have a greater inclination towards collectivism, epidemiological indicators evolve in a better way than in those populations where the culture is individualistic. This work contributes to the field of computational epidemiology by providing a new way of including the social aspects of studied populations in agent-based models to help develop better interventions.
